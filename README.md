# Backend Take-Home: Docker Setup

Welcome to the **Backend Take-Home** assignment repository! This README describes how to install and run Docker so that you can spin up the necessary services (e.g., PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and others) for this project.

## 1. Install Docker

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run software and services in self-contained environments.

- **Mac & Windows**: You’ll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).  
  - Follow the installation prompts (it will install both Docker Engine and Docker Compose).
  - Once installed, launch Docker Desktop and wait until it indicates that Docker is running.

- **Linux**:  
  1. Refer to the [Docker Engine installation instructions for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
  2. (Optional) If you want to avoid using \`sudo\` every time, follow [Post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to add your user to the \`docker\` group.

## 2. Verify Docker Installation

After installing, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like:
```
Docker version 20.10.X, build ...
```
_(Version numbers may vary.)_

You can also test with:
```bash
docker ps
```
If Docker is running, this command should succeed (you might see no running containers or an empty list).

## 3. Bring Up Services with Docker Compose

In this repository, there should be a file named \docker-compose.yml\ which defines the services you need (e.g., PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, etc.).

1. **Navigate** to the project folder containing \docker-compose.yml:
   ```bash
   cd bevel-backend-takehome-food
   ```
2. **Start** the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   or, if you have a newer Docker CLI:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   - This command reads \docker-compose.yml\ and pulls the required images if they’re not already on your machine.
   - It then starts each container in the configuration.

### 3.1 Running in the Background

If you don’t want to watch the logs in your terminal, add the \-d\ flag to run in detached mode:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
_(The containers will continue running in the background.)_

### 3.2 Shutting Down

Press \Ctrl + C\ (in foreground mode) or run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
to stop and remove the containers.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **“Cannot connect to the Docker daemon”** or **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) or the Docker service (Linux) is running.
- **“No such file or directory”**: Make sure you’re running \docker-compose\ from the same directory where \docker-compose.yml\ is located.
- **Permissions** (Linux): If you need to use \sudo docker-compose ...\ each time, consider adding your user to the \docker\ group (see [Linux post-install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)).

## 5. Further Reading

- [Official Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose Overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

You should now be ready to run Docker services for this take-home assignment. If you have any questions or run into issues, let us know!

# Backend Setup
An example express server in provided in the /app directory. You can modify the server to your needs.

## Install global dependencies

```
npm install -g yarn
```

## Install local dependencies

```
yarn install
```
